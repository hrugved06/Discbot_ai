This is a Discord AI Chatbot that uses the [Microsoft DialoGPT conversational model](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/DialoGPT-medium) fine-tuned on the game transcript of Rick and Morty. Refer the Tutorial [ Tutorial on freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/discord-ai-chatbot/) .

I trained the model using the lines of my favorite quirky character, Rick . He has about 700 lines in total in the entire game.

## Structure of this Project

- `model_train_upload_workflow.ipyb`: Notebook to be run in Google Colab to train and upload the model to Hugging Face's Model Hub
- `discord_bot.py`: Script to be imported into a Repl.it Python Discord.py project
